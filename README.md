# Reinforcement Learning in Simple Simulated Navigation Task
Hello, world!

This exploratory project includes the code of different reinforcement learning (RL) implementations to explore [the frozen lake example (FrozenLake-v0) by OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/envs/FrozenLake-v0/).

## Environment Class



# Acknowledgements & Links
I have put together inspirations from multiple sources, without which this project cannot actualize. 

Besides all the StackExchange discussions, the algorithms and implementation ideas in this project are drawn especially from the following sources: 
* **a university course**: [Discourse and Dialogue](http://www.cs233.org), where I was introduced to RL application in dialogue generation
* **a tutorial**: [Introduction to RL in Python](https://www.coursera.org/projects/introduction-to-reinforcement-learning-in-python) on Coursera Project Network
* **a textbook**: [Introduction to RL](https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf) by Sutton & Barto (2nd ed., 2014-15 in progress); page numbers on this page corresponds to pages in this pdf file
* **some skeleton code**: [Source Code for RandomAgent Class](https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/examples/agents/random_agent.py)

# RL Algorithms Explored
## Monte Carlo Estimation
Specifically, this project implements the On-Policy First-Visit Monte-Carlo Control Algorithm for Ïµ-soft Policies. For pseudocode, see Figure 5.6 on p.127 on Sutton & Barto.

## SARSA Temporal Difference (TD) Learning

# Style Notes
For learning purposes, the code in this repository will be more extensively commented than usual.
